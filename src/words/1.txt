Dublin, April 17.—The great event
in Dublin Easter Sunday afternoon
was the funeral o/ Lieutenant Sween-
ey, who was “shot while attempting
to escape” from the custody ‘of the
Beggars Bush troops’ last Monday
evening. He had been in custody for
an offense committed before the
split in the Irish republican army.

The dissentient section of the
army gave Sweeney a public funeral.
Five battalions of the Dublin brigade
formed a procession which wended
its way from Mount Argus to Glasne-
vin Cemetery. The four miles of the
route were lined by crowds of specta-
tors. More than 3,000 men took part
in the march and Sinn Fein Boy
Scouts participated.
